Overview of Project
In this project, we will be developing a text narrator using Amazon Polly. A piece of text (book, article, newsletter) will be uploaded in an Amazon S3 bucket and converted to speech. The voice, pitch and speed parmeters can be adjusted.

Steps to be performed
We'll be going through the following steps.

  1. Exploring Amazon Polly
  2. Creating an IAM role
  3. Creating an S3 Bucket
  4. Writing Lambda function code
  5. Checking the output of Amazon Polly
