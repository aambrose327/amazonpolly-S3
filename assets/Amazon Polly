What is Amazon Polly?
Amazon Polly is a service provided by AWS that enables developers to generate human-like speech from text.

  1. Text-to-Speech Conversion: Amazon Polly turns written text into spoken words. So, you can type something, and Amazon Polly will say it out loud in a natural-sounding voice.
  2. Realistic Speech: The speech created by Amazon Polly sounds like a real person speaking, not robotic or unnatural. It's great for making computerized voices sound more human-like.
  3. Options to Customize: You can change how the speech sounds. For example, you can make it faster or slower, adjust the pitch (high or low), and even pick different accents or languages.
  4. Supports Many Languages and Voices: Amazon Polly can speak in lots of different languages and with different voices. Whether you want a man or a woman, or someone with a British or American accent, you have options.
  5. SSML Support for Control: You can use special codes called SSML to control exactly how the speech sounds. This allows for things like emphasizing certain words, adding pauses, or changing the tone of voice.
